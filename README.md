I realized that I couldn't replicate a QR code just by using its data, which sparked my interest in understanding how QR codes work and how to extract the parameters used to generate them. I created this script to identify the necessary parameters to replicate a QR code for a parking lot. While the code is inefficient, it ultimately served its purpose.
